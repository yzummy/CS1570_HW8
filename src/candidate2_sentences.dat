My opponent is reckless, so reckless, in fact, that she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack.
Elect me and I guarantee tacks cuts across the board. Push pins, thumb tacks, all are inferior to celo tape.
When Shelbyville sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending people like us red-blooded Springfieldians. They're sending their snooty people. They're sending craft beers and vegans.
Frankly, our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.
We will build a great wall on the southern border. And Shelbyville will pay for the wall. One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it.
This is the one. I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Like ET and Spock. Criminal!
It's true. The truth is I'm actually a modest person. Very modest. It's true. In fact, many people tell me that modesty is perhaps my best quality.
I value hard work. I get my hands dirty. Tell me how clean energy is going to give you the dirt of a job well done.
The first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.
Now  look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster.
The things that businesses, as in people, like most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. I'm going to cut taxes big league.
So we have to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is, it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's ten years old. He has computers. He's so good with these computers.
I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table.
I have a great company. I have a great income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.
I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35% to 15% for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Regan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.
Within ICE I'm going create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous illegal immigrants in Springfield who have evaded justice just like my opponent has evaded justice, OK?
